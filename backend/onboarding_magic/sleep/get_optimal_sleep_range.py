        Calculate optimal sleep duration using age, sex, real activity level, goal, and recent sleep patterns.
        
        Based on research for muscle growth and resistance training performance:
        - Sleep needs vary by age and sex (hormonal differences)
        - You need more sleep to recover if you have a higher activity level
        - Sleep debt must be accounted for

        Parameters:
        - age: User's age in years
        - sex: Sex (affects hormonal recovery patterns)
        - activity_level: ActivityLevel from calories burned calculation
        - goal: Goal (muscle_gain_recomp or muscle_retain_recomp or maintain)
        - avg_sleep_last_7_days: Average sleep duration last week (from sleep tracking)
